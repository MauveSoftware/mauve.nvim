# Mauve Neovim Distribution

## Description
This is a minimal (opinionated) Neovim distribution. It's target is to provide useful features for editing files without having too much dependencies/plugins. Since this config is distributed via config management we do not use any plugin managers. Plugin version locking is achieved by using git submodules.

## Requirements
* Neovim 0.11.0+

## Plugins
* [github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/)
